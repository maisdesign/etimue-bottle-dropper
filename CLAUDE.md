# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

### Development
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Database Management
Use the Supabase CLI for database operations:
- `supabase link --project-ref xtpfssiraytzvdvgrsol` - Link to Supabase project
- `supabase functions deploy submit-score` - Deploy score submission edge function
- `supabase functions deploy mailchimp-subscribe` - Deploy newsletter subscription function

## Project Status (as of August 31, 2025)

**âœ… FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - All critical issues have been resolved and the system is ready for production deployment.

### Current Working State
- âœ… Google OAuth authentication working completely
- âœ… Game fully playable with score submission
- âœ… Nickname system with profanity filtering implemented
- âœ… Leaderboards with correct UI alignment and translations
- âœ… All critical UI bugs fixed (modal cleanup, positioning, header alignment)
- âœ… Database connectivity verified and working

### Environment Configuration
- Supabase URL: `https://xtpfssiraytzvdvgrsol.supabase.co`
- Admin UUID: `470c82f5-3997-4d93-a433-4dfee4a199c2`
- Current dev server: port 3000 (`http://localhost:3000`)
- Game title: **"EtimuÃ¨ Bottle Dropper"** (not "EtimÃ¼Ã¨")

## Architecture Overview

This is a **EtimuÃ¨ Bottle Dropper** - a Phaser 3 TypeScript game that integrates with Supabase for authentication, user profiles, and leaderboards. The application follows a scene-based architecture with centralized state management.

### Core Architecture Components

**Game Engine**: Phaser 3 with TypeScript, configured in `src/main.ts` with scenes loaded in sequence

**Authentication Flow**: 
- AuthManager (`src/net/authManager.ts`) handles OAuth with Google/Apple and email OTP
- AuthModal (`src/ui/AuthModal.ts`) provides UI for authentication with nickname system
- Mandatory marketing consent required for gameplay
- OAuth callback handling with hash-based redirects (`#auth-callback`)
- **FIXED**: Double hash issue resolved, OAuth loop eliminated

**Database Integration**:
- Supabase client (`src/net/supabaseClient.ts`) with typed interfaces
- Profiles auto-created via database trigger
- Anti-cheat validation in score submission (0-600 points, min 5 seconds duration)
- Weekly/monthly leaderboards with timezone handling (Europe/Rome)
- **FIXED**: Score submission database constraint issues resolved

**Scene Flow**:
1. BootScene â†’ PreloadScene â†’ MenuScene (auth required)
2. GameScene (main gameplay)
3. GameOverScene (score submission) â†’ LeaderboardScene

### Key Technical Details

**Path Aliases**: Uses `@/` prefix for src imports with Vite/TypeScript resolution:
```typescript
'@/*': ['src/*']
'@/scenes/*': ['src/scenes/*']
'@/net/*': ['src/net/*']
'@/ui/*': ['src/ui/*']
'@/i18n/*': ['src/i18n/*']
'@/net/*': ['src/net/*']
```

**Mobile Support**: Touch controls implemented in GameScene with responsive scaling

**PWA Configuration**: Service worker with Supabase caching, offline support

**Internationalization**: i18n system (`src/i18n/`) supports Italian/English with browser detection

**Nickname System**: 
- Anti-profanity filtering (multilingual IT/EN)
- Validation: 2-20 characters, safe characters only
- Profile modal for existing users to update nicknames
- **FIXED**: Modal cleanup and HTML input positioning

**Environment Variables**:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` for database connection
- `VITE_ADMIN_UUIDS` for admin user identification
- Mailchimp credentials for server-side edge functions

### Anti-Cheat System

Score submission includes validation:
- Score range: 0-600 points
- Game duration: minimum 5 seconds (no artificial upper limit for skilled players)
- Rate limiting and server-side timestamp validation
- **FIXED**: Removed artificial 70-second limit for expert players

### GDPR Compliance

- Cookie consent banner in MenuScene
- Marketing consent required before gameplay
- Consent timestamp stored in profiles
- Privacy policy and terms integration

### Recent Fixes (August 31, 2025)

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- âœ… OAuth callback double hash loop fixed
- âœ… Score submission database constraint resolved
- âœ… Nickname modal cleanup and HTML input positioning fixed
- âœ… Leaderboard "connection error" resolved (listY variable fix)
- âœ… Header alignment fixed (no longer covers weekly/monthly tabs)
- âœ… Translation improvements ("Anonymous" â†’ "Anonimo")

**UI Improvements**:
- âœ… Leaderboard column alignment corrected
- âœ… Trophy positioning improved
- âœ… Extended debug logging in LeaderboardScene
- âœ… Input HTML positioning in profile modal centered correctly

## Development Notes

- Database currently forces 60-second duration constraint (marked for future update)
- Audio files are placeholder (silent) - replace in PreloadScene for production  
- Sprites are programmatically generated - replace with real assets as needed
- OAuth callback uses hash-based routing (`#auth-callback`) for SPA compatibility
- All major functionality tested and working on development server

## Debugging Tips

### Console JavaScript
Check browser console errors when:
1. Logging in with Google OAuth
2. Returning to menu after login
3. Accessing the game
4. Submitting scores
5. Loading leaderboards

### AuthManager Logging
The `authManager.ts` file has active logging:
```javascript
console.log('Auth state changed:', event, session?.user?.email)
```

### Score Service Logging
Extensive logging in score submission for tracking issues:
```javascript
console.log('ðŸ“Š ScoreService.submitScore called:', { userId, score, runSeconds })
```

## Ready for Production Deployment

The system is **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** and ready for deployment to Netlify. All critical bugs identified have been resolved.
